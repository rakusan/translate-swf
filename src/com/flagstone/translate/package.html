<p>The ASParser framework is a collection of classes used to implement a compiler 
for Macromedia's ActionScript Version 1.0. ActionScript statements are parsed 
to generate the byte-codes and actions that will be executed by the Flash Player.</p>

<p>The process of compiling a script take two steps. The script is parsed and 
converted into a tree of ASNodes then it is encoded to generate the binary
data in the Flash (SWF) File Format which specifies the byte-codes and actions
executed by the Flash Player.</p>

<pre>
String script = "a = b + c;"
int swfVersion = 5;

ASParser parser = new ASParser();
ASNode root = parser.parse(script);

byte[] data = root.encode(swfVersion);
</pre>

<p>The version of Flash that the ASNodes will be encoded to is passed to the root
node. The file format of the data structures used to represent movie clip events
and button events changed when Macromedia released Version 6 an 7 of the Flash 
File Format Specification respectively so the version number is required to 
encode the nodes correctly.</p>

<p><b>Frames, Buttons or Movie Clips</b><br/>
The parser can be used to compile scripts that are executed when, a frame is 
displayed, an event occurs in a button or an event occurs in a movie clip.</p>

<p>Scripts that will be executed when a frame is displayed can be encoded then 
added to an FSDoAction object.</p>

<pre>
String script = "gotoFrame(1)";

byte[] encodedActions = parser.parse(script).encode(swfVersion);
FSDoAction frameActions = new FSDoAction(encodedActions);

movie.add(frameActions);
</pre>

<p>For actions executed when an event in a button occurs there are two options
for writing a script, either specify the actions for an individual button event 
or for all the events that a button responds to in a single script.</p>

<p>When specifying the actions that are executed in response to a set of one or 
more events the encoded actions are added to an FSButtonEvent object:</p>

<pre>
String script = "gotoFrame(1)";
int event = FSButtonEvent.Release;

byte[] encodedActions = parser.parse(script).encode(swfVersion);
FSButtonEvent eventActions = new FSButtonEvent(event, encodedActions);
...
button.add(eventActions);
...
movie.add(button);
</pre>

<p>For specifying multiple events ActionScript provides the on() block construct.
When used in a script the nodes are encoded as an array of button event objects
and are added to an FSDefineButton2 object:</p>

<pre>
// This script advances the movie by 10 frames each time a 
// button is clicked.

String script = "
    on (press)
    {
        frameNumber = currentFrame + 10;
    }

    on (release)
    {
        currentFrame = frameNumber
        gotoFrame(frameNumber);
    }
";

byte[] encodedActions = parser.parse(script).encode(swfVersion);
...
button.add(encodedActions);
...
movie.add(button);
</pre>

<p>NOTE: Although a script can contain more than one on() block, other statements 
cannot be mixed with on() statements. The parser will generate an error.</p>

<p>For movie clip events the situation is similar to generating actions for 
buttons. ActionScript contains the onClipEvent() block to allow actions to be
specified for all the events a movie clip responds to in a single script.</p>

<p>Specify the actions for a single event:</p>

<pre>
String script = "startDrag();";
int event = FSClipEvent.MouseDown;

byte[] encodedActions = parser.parse(script).encode(swfVersion);
FSClipEvent eventActions = new FSClipEvent(event, encodedActions);
...
placeObject.add(eventActions);
</pre>

<p>Specify the actions for more than one event.</p>

<pre>
// Drag the mouse clip around the screen with the mouse

String script = "
    on (mouseDown)
    {
        startDrag();
    }

    on (mouseUp)
    {
        stopDrag();
    }
";

byte[] encodedEvents = parser.parse(script).encode(swfVersion);
...
placeObject.add(encodedEvents);
</pre> 

<p>NOTE: As with button events a script can contain more than one onClipEvent() 
block, other statements cannot be mixed with onClipEvent() statements. The 
parser will generate an error.</p>

<p><b>Using ASNodes</b<br/>\n
Generating ASNodes as an intermediate step has two advantages: sections of 
frequently used code can be parsed once and then encoded in the different 
objects added to a movie greatly improving performance. For simple scripts 
trees of ASNodes can be constructed 'manually' - again eliminating the overhead
of the parser.</p>

<pre>
ASNode a = new ASNode(ASNode.Identifier, "a");
ASNode b = new ASNode(ASNode.Identifier, "b");
ASNode c = new ASNode(ASNode.Identifier, "c");

ASNode add = new ASNode(ASNode.Add, a, b);
ASNode assign = new ASNode(a, add);
</pre>

<p>The ASNode class defines a full range of node types ranging from specifying 
literals through to complex structures such as iterative and conditional 
constructs such as for loops and if/else blocks.</p>

<p>The framework contains an example Interpreter class which can be used to 
parse scripts and display a list of ASNode objects that a script is translated
into.</p>

<p><b>Search Paths</b>\n
ActionScript supports #include directives which allow scripts to be nested.
When the script is preprocessed the current working directory is checked for 
for the file specified. The parser also supports search paths which is a list
of directories which should also be checked for the file.</p>

<p>Paths may be specified as an array of path names or as a single string with 
paths separated by the system-dependent path separator character - ';' on Windows
platforms and ':' for Unix compatible platforms.</p>

<p><b>Error Handling</b><br/>
The parser will throw a ParseException if it detects an error in the syntax of
the script it is parsing. The ParseException contains information on the token
that triggered the error however this can be cryptic. More useful information
is maintained by the parser which has four methods for identifying the line 
in the script that triggered the error:</p>

<p>getFilename() returns the name of the file that contained the script that 
caused the error. Scripts are passed as strings to the parser however #include
directives can be used to load files containing ActionScript and can be nested
to any depth. If an error occurs in the script passed directly to the parser 
then this method will return an empty string "", otherwise the name of the 
file that contains the line that caused the error is returned.</p>

<p>getError() returns a string error code that identifies the type of error
that occured, e.g. "FileNotFound". The string can be used as a key to generate 
localized error message. The ASParser class contains a list of error keys.</p>

<p>getLineNumber() returns the line number (starting at 1) in the script where 
the error was found.</p>

<p>getLine() returns the line of code that caused the error.</p>

<pre>
try 
{
    ...
    ASNode root = parser.parse(script);
    ...
}
catch (ParseException e)
{
    String filename = parser.getFilename();
    String line = parser.getLine();
    String message = parser.getError();
    int lineNumber = parser.getLineNumber();
    ...
}
</pre>
