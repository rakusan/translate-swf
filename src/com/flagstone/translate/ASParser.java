/**
 * The ASParser framework is a collection of classes used to implement a compiler 
 * for Macromedia's ActionScript, Version 1.0. ActionScript statements are parsed 
 * to generate the byte-codes and actions that will be executed by the Flash Player.
 * 
 * The parser translates ActionScript into a tree of ASNode objects which are then
 * encoded to the byte-codes and actions that will be executed by the Flash Player.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     String script = "gotoFrame(1)";
 * 
 *     byte[] encodedActions = parser.parse(script).encode(swfVersion);
 * </pre>
 *
 * The version of Flash (swf) that the script is being encoded for must be passed
 * to the root ASNode when the tree of nodes is encoded. The format of the data 
 * structures that represent clip and button events changed when version 6 and 
 * version 7 of the Flash File Format Specification was released.
 *
 * <b>Search Paths</b><br/>
 * ActionScript supports #include directives which allow scripts to be nested.
 * When the script is preprocessed the current working directory is checked for 
 * for the file specified. The parser also supports search paths which is a list
 * of directories which should also be checked for the file.
 *
 * Paths may be specified as an array of path names or as a single string with 
 * paths separated by the system-dependent path separator character - ';' on Windows
 * platforms and ':' for Unix compatible platforms. The string is split into 
 * separate paths and added to the array of paths searched.
 *
 * The directories are searched in the order they were added to the array of paths
 * maintained by the parser.
 *
 * <b>Error Handling</b><br/>
 * If an error occurs while parsing the script an exception is thrown. The ParseException
 * contains detailed information on the token sequence that caused the parser to 
 * generate the error. This informatrion can be hard to decipher and should not 
 * be presented to an end-user of an application. The ASParser object generates 
 * more user/script-writer friendly information that can be used to identify 
 * the line in a script that generated the error.
 *
 * <pre>
 *    try 
 *    {
 *        String script = "on(mouseDown) { startDrag(); }";
 *        ...
 *        ASNode root = parser.parse(script);
 *        ...
 *    }
 *    catch (ParseException e)
 *    {
 *        String filename = parser.getFilename();
 *        String line = parser.getLine();
 *        String message = parser.getError();
 *        int lineNumber = parser.getLineNumber();
 *        ...
 *    }
 * </pre>

/*
 * Primary expressions are split into a prefix/suffix pair. This allows some of the more 
 * esoteric features of ActionScript to be handled cleanly, specifically variables and 
 * array elments can contain objects and even functions. The statement a[1](arg) is 
 * valid ActionScript - the first element of the array contains a function which is 
 * executed passing the argument, arg.
 *
 * Suffixing also allows object path names, e.g. a.b.c() to be correctly parsed.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: The Identifier() node looks ahead to see whether the indentifier is 
 * actually the name of a function. The node looksahead to see if the identifier 
 * token is followed by a Function() node. If so the tokens are consumed.
